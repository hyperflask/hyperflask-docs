# Status & Roadmap

Hyperflask is being actively developed and is not yet ready for production.

Checkout the list of all the projects developed as part of the Hyperflask Stack and their current development status on the [Hyperflask Github organization homepage](https://github.com/hyperflask).

Key stuff that is still missing:

- [Image optimizations](/guides/assets/#optimized-images)
- Syntax highlighting for the macro tags syntax in jinja templates
