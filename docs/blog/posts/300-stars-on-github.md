# 300 stars on Github

Almost a month ago, I announced Hyperflask and posted the link on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45604673). The submission was very well recieved, staying 24h on the front page. Since then, the Hyperflask project on Github has reached 300 stars.

It will take time to build momentum around a new framework but I'm already very happy with the positive feedback I've recieved. Thank you to everybody who read about and/or tried Hyperflask !

If you have tried out the framework, please leave a comment on the [Github disccusion thread](https://github.com/hyperflask/hyperflask/discussions/2) or shout me an email (maxime.bouroumeau@gmail.com). I would love to hear about your experience.
