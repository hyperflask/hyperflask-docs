To use one of these services with hyperflask, retrieve the SMTP connection settings from your account and configure your app accordingly.

Remember to properly configure SPF, DKIM and DMARC to guarantee delivery.

## Self-hosting an SMTP server

We do not recommand self-hosting your SMTP server as delivery guarantee is tough for unknown servers.

If you wish to go this route, simply installing `postfix` and properly configuring your DNS will get you started.
