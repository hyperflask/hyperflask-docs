        <h2>Backend-driven interactive apps</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperflask is built on top of <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a>, a popular Python web framework. It is easy to use and master. Backend-driven apps ensure straighforward state management and limit a lot of footguns from frontend-heavy apps. Combined with <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> and a component system, creating interactive apps is easier than ever.

        <h2>A powerful component system</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperflask introduces component-driven architecture to Flask apps. Seamlessly create frontend (web components, react, etc...) and backend components and use them in your jinja templates. Use HTMX to create server-backed interactive components.

        <h2>File-based routing</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperflask extends Flask with many powerful features, notably file-based routing using a new file format that combines python code and a jinja template (inspired by Astro pages).

        <p>
            The Hyperflask framework itself is a small code base. It combines many Flask extensions in a seamless manner.
            All extensions and related projects are developed independently of the framework under the Hyperflask organization.
            Feel free to pick and choose the part you prefer from Hyperflask and use them in your own projects.
