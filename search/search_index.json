The development world, and especially the javascript world, moves at a very fast pace. There is a lot of good stuff happening but at the same time it often feels overwhelming.</p> <p>On top of the difficulty of selecting technologies, it seems we favor complexity over simplicity. Frameworks and libraries should aim to improve the life of developers with better DX not the opposite. I like the idea of conceptual compression championned by DHH. It is of course harder to make complicated things simple. We should keep innovating and finding better ways to program, not just let React win because LLMs are well trained on it!</p> <p>Backend driven architectures and javascript-light approaches simplifiy web development greatly. HTMX is a key piece of this renaissance of pre-heavy-frontend development. I'm hopeful as it seems SPA-everything as reached its apogee and the trend is shifting back, with the rise of SSR in the javascript world.</p> <p>I do not find the direction React Server Components are following appealing. Blurring the line between frontend and backend has been tried before and it often leads to spaghetti code bases that are hard to maintain. It may make sense in Backend For Fronted architectures but I feel it is too complicated for most projects. Furthermore, I feel the backend building experience in javascript has never been great, far from python, php or rails.</p> <p>At the same time, I feel the developer experience is lacking in many areas. There's so many moving parts to learn and manage, it's daunting. It's especially hard for beginners.</p> <p>In the end, I love Python and Flask and want to continue building modern websites with them. Unfortunately, I felt a lot of extensions have become outdated and Flask being minimalist, no large scale frameworks around it. Hyperflask is my attempt to a super-powered Flask-based stack.</p> <p>Finally, in the age of AI driven development, we shouldn't (yet) let AI generate tech architecture and core technologies. At the moment, AI is the perfect companion for product building, generating individual components and pages. Hyperflask is built with this in mind: to allow AI generation to operate at a very high level, limiting impact on core architectural choices and security implications.</p>"},{"location":"why/#acknowledgments","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"<p>Hyperflask is inspired by many:</p> <ul> <li>Ruby on Rails because of their backend-first, one man framework philosophy</li> <li>Astro for their page format, component islands and static content-first approach</li> <li>Jekyll for their content collections</li> <li>htmx for allowing to build web sites with minimal custom js</li> <li>Laravel for the everything included approach</li> <li>and many other open source projects</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/09/24/launch-annoncement/","title":"Launch annoncement","text":"<p>After 2 years of working on &amp; off on Hyperflask, I'm happy to finally announce a working version that can be used to create actual production apps ! Although it is still in beta, all the desired features are present and working.</p> <p>In reality, Hyperflask is more than 10 years in the making ! My previous attempt at a comprehensive framework went nowhere but some of its ideas survived. The rise of htmx and the revival of backend driven apps led me to get excited again.</p> <p>Backend-driven apps using something like htmx are not an answer to all type of web development. However, I'm convinced that they provide a solution for 80% of use cases (if not more) while simplying greatly the development experience, the cognitive load and the many footguns that frontend-heavy frameworks bring.</p> <p>I love Flask as a framework but unfortunately, a lot of Flask extensions are barely maintained. In the meantime, other frameworks have introduced amazing innovations that greatly simplify the developer experience. Hyperflask is my attempt at synthetizing all the parts I like across various technologies and frameworks in a coherent stack. Integration between each chosen technology should be completely seamless.</p> <p>Among these innovations, notable ones are:</p> <ul> <li>File-based routing with a new file format that combines some python code and a jinja template, inspired by Astro pages</li> <li>A component system inspired by frontend frameworks and Astro islands. It can be used to create frontend or backend components. Components can have their own endpoints.</li> <li>Using streaming content to display loaders, inspired by React Suspense</li> <li>Static content generation with collections, inspired by Jekyll</li> </ul> <p>More than just a framework, Hyperflask is a truly full stack solution. From dev environments, to UI framework to deployments. On top of the previously mentionned features, Hyperflask provides:</p> <ul> <li>Deep integration with htmx</li> <li>An easy to use and powerful ORM that stays close to SQL</li> <li>A large library of UI components powered by Tailwind, DaisyUI and Bootstrap Icons</li> <li>A modern assets pipeline using esbuild with image optimizations</li> <li>Server push for realtime updates using SSE, based on the Mercure protocol</li> <li>Template based emails powered by MJML</li> <li>Background tasks</li> <li>Translations</li> <li>Dev environments based on dev containers</li> <li>Deployments using containers</li> </ul> <p>All the technologies used by Hyperflask have been carefully selected for their quality, developer experience, ease of use, feature set and popularity.</p> <p>The framework is optimized to limit \"magic\" features while ensuring ease of use. React Server Components or Phoenix LiveView are impressive but they hide too many things, often leading to many footguns and hacks around them. In Hyperflask, everything is just Python, standard Flask and Jinja with jinjapy files and htmx as the binding agent.</p> <p>One of my side goals with Hyperflask is to revive and modernize the Flask ecosystem. As a result, almost all of the features listed before have been developed as independent Flask extensions. Hyperflask itself is mostly glue code to make them work together. Pick and choose the extensions you want for your own projects.</p> <p>In the same spirit, there are some projects developed as part of Hyperflask that can be used indepently of Flask:</p> <ul> <li>sqlorm, a performant and straighforward ORM that does not attempt to hide SQL</li> <li>jinjapy, a new file format that combines python code and a jinja template</li> <li>jinja-super-macros, a new syntax to call macros in jinja</li> <li>uilib-spec, a specification to generate bindings for UI component libraries (see uilib-spec-daisyui for a use case)</li> <li>docker-web-deploy, a CLI tool to deploy containers to various platforms, including VPS</li> </ul> <p>All these projects are available on the Hyperflask Github organization.</p> <p>Check out the Getting Started tutorial, read more about the goals, technologies and reasoning behind the project or deep dive into the guides.</p> <p>PS: I've already used Hyperflask to build SQLify as part of my job at Digicoop and the experience was very satisfying.</p>"},{"location":"components/","title":"Components","text":"<p>Hyperflask includes a rich set of UI components from DaisyUI as well as utility components deeply integrated with Hyperflask.</p> <p>Learn more on how to use and create components in the components guide.</p>"},{"location":"components/forms/","title":"Forms","text":"<p>Use the <code>Form</code> component with a form object to write the form tag.
