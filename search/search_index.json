A good portion of them are being developed under the Hyperflask umbrella. They are kept independant so they can be re-used in other projects outside of Hyperflask.</p> <p>Checkout the Github organization for the list of projects.</p>"},{"location":"why/#reasoning","title":"Reasoning","text":"<p>There are so many choices to make nowadays: what backend framework, what build tools, what frontend framework, how to deploy, how to easily develop locally, etc... The development world, and especially the javascript world, moves at a very fast pace which feels overwhelming and hard to keep track. There is a lot of good stuff happening but at the same time it often feels needlessly over engineered. The focus is mostly on frontend frameworks and the javascript stack.</p> <p>I think the \"SPA everything\" trend has reach its apogee. I never understood why use frontend component frameworks to build blogs as SPA apps. It seems ridiculous. This trend is shifting, with the rise of SSR in the javascript world. But it feels like they are rediscovering water.</p> <p>I do not find the direction React Server Components are taking appealing. Blurring the line between frontend and backend has been tried before and it often leads to spaghetti code bases that are hard to maintain. Furthermore, I feel the backend building experience in javascript has never been great, far from python, php or rails.</p> <p>At the same time, I feel the developer experience is lacking in many areas. There's so many moving parts to learn and manage, it's daunting. It's especially hard for beginners.</p> <p>In the end, I love Python and Flask and want to continue building modern websites with them. Unfortunately, I felt a lot of extensions have become outdated and Flask being minimalist, no large scale frameworks around it. Hyperflask is my attempt to a super-powered Flask-based stack.</p> <p>There are other \"full stack\" framework but I haven't encountered ones that go as far as this project. In some ways, Hyperflask might be similar to what some \"SaaS starter kit\" are doing. However, I feel Hyperflask is more in-between, where you still have the freedom to make some choices.</p>"},{"location":"why/#acknowledgments","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"<p>Hyperflask is inspired by many:</p> <ul> <li>Ruby on Rails because of their backend-first, one man framework philosophy</li> <li>Astro for their page format and static content-first approach</li> <li>Jekyll for their content collections</li> <li>htmx for allowing to build web sites with minimal custom js</li> <li>and many other open source projects</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/setup/","title":"Setup","text":""},{"location":"guides/setup/#installation","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"guides/setup/#creating-a-new-project","title":"Creating a new project","text":""},{"location":"guides/setup/#development-environment","title":"Development environment","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/assets/","title":"Assets","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/emails/","title":"Emails","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/forms/","title":"Forms","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/models/","title":"Models","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/pages/","title":"Pages","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/pages/#using-page-actions","title":"Using page actions","text":"<p>Page actions allow you to handle multiple actions through a single POST endpoint.</p> <pre><code>from flask import Flask, render_template_string\nfrom flask_mercure import Mercure\nfrom flask_stream import PushStream, page_action\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nMercure(app)\nstream = PushStream(app)\n\n@app.route(\"/\", methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\"])\ndef index():\n\n    @page_action\n    def on_send():\n        stream.append_to(\"#messages\", f\"&lt;p&gt;{request.form['message']}&lt;/p&gt;\")\n\n    @page_action\n    def on_clear():\n        stream.replace_content(\"#messages\", \"\")\n\n    return render_template_string(\"\"\"\n        &lt;form {{hx_page_action(\"send\")}}&gt;\n            &lt;textarea name=\"message\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n            &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n        &lt;div id=\"messages\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;button {{hx_page_action(\"clear\")}}&gt;clear all&lt;/button&gt;\n        {{connect_push_stream(include_scripts=True)}}\n    \"\"\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/basics/structure/","title":"Project structure","text":""},{"location":"guides/basics/ui/","title":"UI","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-further/apppy/","title":"app.py","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-further/auth/","title":"Authentication","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-further/i18n/","title":"Internationalization","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-further/push/","title":"Push","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-further/pwa/","title":"Progressive Web Apps","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-further/tasks/","title":"Tasks","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-to-prod/deploy/","title":"Deploying","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-to-prod/monitoring/","title":"Monitoring","text":""},{"location":"guides/going-to-prod/provisioning/","title":"Provisioning","text":""},{"location":"recipes/analytics/","title":"Web &amp; product analytics","text":""},{"location":"recipes/stripe/","title":"Stripe Checkout","text":""},{"location":"recipes/using-cms/","title":"Using a CMS","text":""}]}
